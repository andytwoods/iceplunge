    A community-led citizen science study into how cold-water immersion affects
    real-world cognitive performance.

      What we're trying to understand
    </summary>
    <div class="content mb-5 ml-4">
      <p>
        Cold-water immersion has attracted enormous popular interest, but the evidence on
        its cognitive effects is thin, inconsistent, and largely based on small, one-off
        laboratory studies. We want to do something different: collect dense, repeated
        measurements from real people in real conditions, over months and years.
      </p>
      <p>The central questions driving the project are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Acute effects –</strong> does a cold plunge sharpen or slow cognition
          in the hours immediately after? Is there a sweet spot, or does intensity or
          duration change the picture?
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Dose and frequency –</strong> does plunging more often lead to different
          baseline cognitive performance? Is the relationship linear, or U-shaped?
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Adaptation over time –</strong> do effects change as people become more
          experienced cold-water practitioners?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Because the data are collected <em>by</em> community members <em>from</em>
        community members, the findings belong to the community. Anonymised results will
        be shared openly.

      The cognitive tasks
    </summary>
    <div class="content mb-5 ml-4">
      <p>
        Each session takes around 5 minutes and consists of up to five short tasks,
        presented in a randomised order. All run in your browser – no app download required.
      </p>

      <div class="columns is-multiline mt-3">

        <div class="column is-6">
          <p class="has-text-weight-semibold mb-1">Reaction time &amp; vigilance (PVT)</p>
          <p>
            A 60-second Psychomotor Vigilance Task: respond as fast as you can when a
            stimulus appears. We measure median reaction time, how much it varies, and how
            many <em>lapses</em> (responses slower than 500 ms) occur – a sensitive index
            of mental fatigue and alertness.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="column is-6">
          <p class="has-text-weight-semibold mb-1">Sustained attention &amp; impulse control (SART)</p>
          <p>
            Respond to frequent targets but withhold your response to rare non-targets.
            Errors of commission measure inhibitory control; response-time variability
            reflects how well attention is maintained over time.
          </p>

        <div class="column is-6">
          <p class="has-text-weight-semibold mb-1">Executive control &amp; selective attention (Flanker)</p>
          <p>
            Respond to a central arrow while ignoring flanking arrows that may point in a
            different direction. The difference in reaction time between congruent and
            incongruent trials – the <em>conflict effect</em> – is a well-validated measure
            of executive control.

        <div class="column is-6">
          <p class="has-text-weight-semibold mb-1">Processing speed (Digit Symbol)</p>
          <p>
            Match digits to symbols as quickly as possible using a key. Correct responses
            per minute captures processing speed and perceptual-motor coordination – one
            of the broadest indicators of overall cognitive efficiency.

          <p>
            Four quick ratings: valence (how positive you feel), arousal/energy, stress,
            and mental sharpness. These let us separate objective cognitive performance
            from how people <em>feel</em> – and how the two relate.

      What else shapes cognition – and why we capture it
    </summary>
    <div class="content mb-5 ml-4">
      <p>
        Cognitive performance doesn't exist in a vacuum. Many factors influence how sharp
        your brain is on any given day. We record these not to be intrusive, but because
        failing to account for them would make the data scientifically worthless. All
        fields are optional, and the more context you provide, the more useful your
        contribution.
      </p>

      <div class="columns is-multiline mt-3">

        <div class="column is-6">
          <p class="has-text-weight-semibold mb-1">Plunge timing &amp; dose</p>
          <p>
            How long ago did you plunge? Water temperature, immersion depth, duration, and
            context (bath, lake, sea, cryotherapy) all contribute to the dose. Frequency
            over 7, 14, and 30 days lets us model adaptation.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="column is-6">
          <p class="has-text-weight-semibold mb-1">Sleep</p>
          <p>
            Sleep is the single strongest within-person predictor of reaction time and
            vigilance. Duration and quality are recorded daily so we can separate
            cold-water effects from the simple fact that you slept badly last night.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="column is-6">
          <p class="has-text-weight-semibold mb-1">Caffeine &amp; alcohol</p>
          <p>
            Caffeine acutely improves vigilance; alcohol impairs it, with effects that
            persist well beyond the feeling of intoxication. We record caffeine since your
            last session and any alcohol in the past 24 hours.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="column is-6">
          <p class="has-text-weight-semibold mb-1">Exercise &amp; meal timing</p>
          <p>
            Acute exercise can boost executive function temporarily; exercising to
            exhaustion can impair it. We also note time since your last meal, as low blood
            glucose affects sustained attention.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="column is-6">
          <p class="has-text-weight-semibold mb-1">Illness &amp; gastrointestinal symptoms</p>
          <p>
            Even mild illness meaningfully impairs cognition. GI symptoms are captured
            weekly because some practitioners report gut-related effects from cold-water
            immersion – a poorly studied area.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="column is-6">
          <p class="has-text-weight-semibold mb-1">Baseline profile</p>
          <p>
            Age, sex, handedness, height, weight, and years of cold-water experience –
            collected once at sign-up. These allow us to model individual differences and
            avoid confounding group-level patterns with personal baseline variation.

      How participating works
    </summary>
    <div class="content mb-5 ml-4">
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Create an account</strong> and complete a brief baseline questionnaire
          (age, experience, etc.) and informed consent. No data is collected before consent.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Log your plunges</strong> as you do them – water temperature, duration,
          depth, context. This takes under a minute.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Receive gentle notifications</strong> (optional) around 15–30 minutes and
          again 2–3 hours after each plunge, prompting a short cognitive session. You can
          also complete sessions at any time independently of a plunge.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Complete a 5-minute session</strong> – a few short cognitive tasks and a
          mood check-in.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>See your own data</strong> on your personal dashboard: reaction time
          trends, attention patterns, mood trajectories, and how they relate to your
          plunge history.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        You can participate as much or as little as you like. More frequent sessions mean
        a richer personal dataset and a stronger contribution to the group analysis, but
        there is no obligation.
